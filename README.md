## Gulp

Most of the performance optimizations are done with gulp tasks set in `gulpfile.js`. The resulting files will be sent to `/dist` folder. You may run:
  - `gulp minify` to install html, css, js, and image files
  - `gulp build` to minify and bundle css and js files.
  - `gulp` to clean, copy and build
